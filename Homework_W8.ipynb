    "This greedy algorithm maximized the hours worked per guard at the lowest average hourly rate. We have 6 guards available that each can work from 0-24 hours shifts. There are many ways this can be solved. For example, we can try to determine the number of guards we need and the shift length for each guard that add up to 24 hours. This approach then assumes that each guard will work equal hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have taken a little different approach. In my greedy algorithm, we iterate over each guard and each shift and then minimize the average hourly cost. For example, we start with guard 1 and estimate the maximum hours to work ***given the average minimum wage***:\n",

Intuitively we know that we could employ 6 guards to work 4 hours each for the average cost of   15 dollars, or 4 guards to work 6 hours each for the average cost of 15 dollars. These all yield the cost of 360 as our current solution. \n",

    "This algorithm will be successful as long as we are seeking the solution for 24 hours of labor, and as long as we are working with nice constraints (e.g. 2,4,6,8 hours shifts). To expand this solution to calculate more than 24 periods we need to start accounting and resetting the overtime period in our loops. This could be done by, for example, using a queue where we would deque and enqueue a guard after 24 hour period.\n",

For that, a simple solution is to add another checkpoint in the code that verifies the next guard shift to be equal to 24 minus the sum of the hours from the previous guards.

    "My greedy algorithm optimizes the solution for 24 shifts by iteration over all guards and all possible shifts (with 1-hour increments) and minimizing the average hourly cost (see discussion for more detail). This algorithm is greedy in the sense that it optimizes locally and it might not provide optimal solutions all the time. In my approach, we did find the global minimum. The results of this optimization are as follows:\n",

    "This is explored more in detail in the discussion section. The time complexity of such an algorithm is O(G x S) where G is the number of guards and S is the number of shifts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problems like these can also be solved as a form of optimization with objective function specification. In this case, we are utilizing the greedy algorithm but the simplex method is a better option if we are seeking the best solution. The exhaustive approach is also possible but quite inefficient. For smaller problems, the exhaustive approach might still work."
